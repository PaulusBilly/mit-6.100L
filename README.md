# MIT 6.100L: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets for the MIT 6.100L course (Fall 2022).

## Course Description

6.100L is an introduction to computer science and programming for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.

## Problem Sets

This repository is organized by problem set. Each problem set directory contains the original problem set description and my solution.

*   **Problem Set 0:** [ps0.py](pset_0/ps0.py)

## Notes

This section will contain my personal notes and reflections on the course material and problem sets.
